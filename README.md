# correlational-tractography-DSI-Studio
Shell script to perform correlational tractography (connectometry analysis) in DSI Studio

DSI Studio allows manual performance of correlational tractography, but for large numbers of study variables, a shell script is handy.
Script based on Documentation from https://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/
